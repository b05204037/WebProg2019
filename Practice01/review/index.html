There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...<br>
<mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
</p>
<p>
You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
<blockquote>
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
we seek.
</blockquote>

<h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
<div>
<p>A < div > is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
and take up the full width available.
</p>
</div>
<span>
<p>
And a < span > tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
